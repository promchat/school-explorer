- [ ] Create an _index.html_ with a basic HTML page structure
- [ ] Create an empty CSS file for the project
- [ ] Create an empty JavaScrip file for the project
- [ ] Link to the empty CSS file from the bottom of the `head` of your HTML file
- [ ] Link to the empty JavaScript file from the bottom of the `body` of your HTML file

- [ ] Create a function called `makeSchoolFeature` to transform one of the school elements into a GeoJSON-like feature. **This function should be made available globally (on the window object)**.
- [ ] Use the function to display all the `schools` data on the map.
- [ ] Create a function to show an array of schools on the map.
